Now that we know how to make a conda environment we can use it to install snakemake into. 

I run the following commands in this video:

```
conda create --name smake
source activate smake
conda env list #checks to see the environment was created
conda install snakemake
```


Note that once you get ~90secs in the installtion process goes for a bit so jump ahead to 11:15 in the video... to see the end. The `exit` command used at the end is just for the recording software and doesn't have to do with conda.
